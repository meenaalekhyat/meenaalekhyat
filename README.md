# Hi there, I'm Meena Alekhyat! ðŸ‘‹

I am a neurodivergent programmer with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering. Currently, I am on an exciting journey to learn and master Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, with the goal of researching in the field of Bioinformatics if I get into grad school.

## About Me
